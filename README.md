Quest for the Graphical Web

This is an experimental experience showcasing current and coming features of the graphical web.
The site can be run out of the src folder, but requires a local server, like MAMP (http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html), to run. The build script uses PHING to compile/compress all the working files into the site directory for a compressed version.

Tools to build
* Require.js (http://requirejs.org/)
* SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) 
* Compass (http://compass-style.org/)
* PHING (http://www.phing.info/trac/)
